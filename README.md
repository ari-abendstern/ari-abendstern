## Hello! 👋

Have you arrived here via a link in my CV to look at my GitHub Contributions Graph? 🟩🟩🟩⬜️⬜️

Does the amount of coding I have (or haven't) been doing have the potential to influence a decision that might make a profound difference to my future? 🔮

If so, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could factor in that a lot of my coding doesn't show up on the graph! 😶‍🌫️

For example:
- I've been tinkering with Arduinos and other IOT devices - it's been great to try coding in a new language (based on C++) and it's very satisfying to write code that has an effect on a physical object... but none of that code is linked to my GitHub 💡
- All of the contributions I've made whilst doing work experience have used another developer's GitHub account 👥
- A huge chunk of the coding I've done since graduating from Northcoders has been helping other graduates debug or move past blockers in their projects, which has been a really helpful way to fast-track learning common errors and how to fix them... but again, GitHub is oblivious 🧑‍🔧

**TLDR: Please don't judge all the white squares, I did lots of coding while GitHub wasn't looking!**

All the very best!

Ari
